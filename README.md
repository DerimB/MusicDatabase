# Music Database (Fall 2023)

## Introduction:
As part of the Principles of Databases course, I completed a Music Database project. This project extended work from a previous project by enhancing the MySQL database. The enhancement involved separating content into distinct relations (tables), establishing relationships between these tables, implementing key constraints, and optimizing the music database. A crucial part of this project was understanding and utilizing Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams to design the database schema.

## Key Achievements:
- **ER Diagram Understanding:** Utilized ER diagrams to understand and define the relationships between different entities in the music database. This included one-to-many and many-to-many relationships, represented in the database as foreign keys.
- **Database Enhancement:** Enhanced a MySQL-based music database, showcasing proficiency in database management. This involved creating and modifying tables based on the ER diagram.
- **Advanced MySQL Implementation:** Implemented advanced MySQL features for improved data organization and relationships. This included creating complex queries to extract meaningful information from the database.

## Technical Skills:
- **Database Design:** Leveraged MySQL to optimize the structure and relationships within the music database. This involved translating the ER diagram into a functional database schema.
- **MySQL:** Demonstrated proficiency in MySQL through the creation and management of a complex music database.
